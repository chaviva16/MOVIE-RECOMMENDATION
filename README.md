🎬 Movie Recommendation System

📌 Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach to provide personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
	•	📌 Personalized Movie Suggestions based on user preferences.
	•	🔍 Search Functionality to find movies by title, genre, or other attributes.
	•	📊 Machine Learning Algorithms for recommendation generation.
	•	🎭 Diverse Genres to cater to different user interests.
	•	📈 Scalability to handle a large dataset of movies and users.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
	•	Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
	•	Streamlit (Web Interface)

## 📊 How It Works
	1.	Data Collection: The system uses a dataset containing movies, user ratings, and genres.

	2.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data for training.

	3.	Model Training: Using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.
